# Catalys 2

Catalyst is a CMS that helps users manage website content easily and quickly. It is built on CodeIgniter 2.0.2 and uses the best features of CMSs that I have used and puts them in one CMS. The Goal of Catalyst2 is to be a front-end agnostic CMS that utilizes a REST API to allow content to be consumed by any front-end, so there are no limits to the front end. 


## Catalyst 2 features
* Custom modules
* Custom fields
* Custom sortable module items



## Current status 
I am currently building the framework. There have been many usability changes from Catalyst 1.5, so I am starting from scratch to make Catalyst 2.

## Things to do
* Create a Module Editor
* Create a Field Editor
